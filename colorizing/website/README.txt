Text giving a brief overview of the project, and text describing your approach. If you ran into problems on images, describe how you tried to solve them. The website does not need to be pretty; you just need to explain what you did.

The result of your algorithm on all of our example images. List the offsets you calculated. Do not turn in the large .tiff images. Your web page should only display compressed images (e.g. jpg or png or gif if you want to animate something).

The result of your algorithm on a few examples of your own choosing, downloaded from the Prokudin-Gorskii collection.

If your algorithm failed to align any image, provide a brief explanation of why.

Describe any bells and whistles you implemented. For maximum credit, show before and after images.

Remember not to use any absolute links to images etc on your computer, as these will not work online. Only use relative links within your folder.
